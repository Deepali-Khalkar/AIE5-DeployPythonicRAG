# Deploying Pythonic Chat With Your Text File Application

In today's breakout rooms, we will be following the processed that you saw during the challenge - for reference, the instructions for that are available [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Beyond-ChatGPT/tree/main).

Today, we will repeat the same process - but powered by our Pythonic RAG implementation we created last week. 

You'll notice a few differences in the `app.py` logic - as well as a few changes to the `aimakerspace` package to get things working smoothly with Chainlit.

## Deploying the Application to Hugging Face Space

Due to the way the repository is created - it should be straightforward to deploy this to a Hugging Face Space!
